 ## Installation
 
 To install, excute the following command on the prompt
 
     $ pip install snorer
 
 and everything should be processed on-the-fly.
 
 ### Dependency
 
-`dukes` requires these external packages
+`snorer` requires python >= 3.8 and the following packages these external packages
 
 - `numpy` >= 1.20.0
 - `scipy` >= 1.10.0
 - `vegas` >= 6.0.1
+- `astropy` >= 6.0.0
+
+where `vegas` is a the backend engine for evaluating multidimensional integrals based on adaptive Monte Carlo vegas algorithm, see its homepage: <a heref = "https://pypi.org/project/vegas/" target = "_blank">https://pypi.org/project/vegas/</a>.
+
+Other packages maybe required by these dependencies during the installation, see `requirements.txt` for details.
+The versions of these dependencies are not strict, but are recommended to update to the latest ones to avoid incompatibility.
+
+## Usage
+
+We briefly summarize the usage in this section and a comprehensive tutorial can be found in the jupyter notebook in `examples/tutorial.ipynb`.
+
+To import, do
+
+    >>> import snorer
+
+in python terminal and is similar in the jupyter notebook.
+All functions and classes can be accessed by typing `snorer.foo()` where `foo` is the name.
+
+
+
+
+### Useful Constants
+
+We document various useful physical constants and conversion factors...etc as the *attributes* of an instance `snorer.constant`.
+For example, we can retrieve
+
+    >>> snorer.constant.me      # electron mas, MeV
+    0.511
+    >>> snorer.constant.kpc2cm  # kpc to cm
+    3.085e+21
+
+We did this instead of naming them as constant variables in some module to prevent them from being edited.
+
+### BDM Velocity
+
+A boosted dark matter (BDM) with mass $m_\chi$ and kinetic energy $T_\chi$ has the velocity $v_\chi$,
+
+$$
+\frac{v_\chi}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{T_\chi(2m_\chi+T_\chi)}}{m_\chi+T_\chi}.
+$$
+
+Let $(T_\chi,m_\chi)=(15,0.075)$ MeV, we can use
+`snorer.get_vx()` to evaluate
+
+    >>> Tx,mx = 15,0.075
+    >>> snorer.get_vx(Tx,mx)
+    0.9999876239921284
+
+
+### SN*Î½* BDM Flux 
+
+The BDM flux, or *afterglow* to the ${\rm SN}\nu$, due to SN that is $R_\star$ distant away from us can be evaluated by 
+
+$$
+\frac{d\Phi_{\chi}(T_\chi, t^\prime)}{dT_{\chi}dt} =
+\tau\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\sin\theta d\theta~ \mathcal{J} j_{\chi}(r(\phi),D,T_{\chi},\psi)
+$$
+
+where $t$ is the BDM ToF with time-zero at the discovery of SN*Î½* on Earth and $t^\prime$ is the total time. We focus on $t$ instead of $t^\prime$.
+Zenith angle $\theta$ and azimuthal angle $\phi$ are relative to the SN-Earth line-of-sight. The default DM-*Î½* cross section is $\sigma_{\chi\nu}=10^{-45}$ cm<sup>2</sup>.
+
+The function to evaluate this flux is `snorer.flux()` with $(t,T_\chi,m_\chi,R_\star,\beta)$ are the necessary inputs. 
+Suppose SN's location is at GC, we have $R_\star=8.5$ kpc and $\beta=0$, and examine the flux with turning on DM spike feature
+
+    >>> t,Tx,mx,Rstar,beta = 100,15,1e-2,8.5,0
+    >>> snorer.flux(t,Tx,mx,Rstar,beta,neval=15000)
+    4.572295175982701e-16
+
+Users can turn off the spike feature by inserting `is_spike=False` and will find both numerical results are similar. It implies the contribution to the BDM flux is due to the place outside the spike's influencial region.
+
+### SN*Î½* BDM Event
+
+The BDM event number in a detector after exposing to the flux for a period of time, $(t_{\rm min},t_{\rm max})$, can be evaluated by
+
+$$
+N_{\rm BDM} = \int_{t_{\rm min}}^{\rm t_{\rm max}} dt \int_{T_{\chi,{\rm min}}}^{T_{\chi,{\rm max}}}
+\frac{d\Phi_{\chi}(T_\chi, t^\prime)}{dT_{\chi}dt} \times N_e \sigma_{\chi e}
+$$
+
+where $N_e$ is the total electron number in the detector and $\sigma_{\chi e}$ the DM-*e* cross section.
+This can be accomplished by `snorer.event()` with $(m_\chi,R_\star,\beta)$ the necessary inputs.
+The default $(t_{\rm min},t_{\rm max})=(10~{\rm s},35~{\rm yrs})$ and $(T_{\chi,{\rm min}},T_{\chi,{\rm max}})=(5,30)$ MeV.
+
+Note that this function is normalized to $N_e=1$ and $\sigma_{\chi e}=1$ cm<sup>2</sup>.
+To have the correct $N_{\rm BDM}$ in a specific detector, users have to mutiply the corresponding $N_e$ and $\sigma_{\chi e}$.
+
+Now let $m_\chi=0.015$ MeV,
+
+    >>> mx,Rstar,beta = 0.015,8,0
+    >>> N_BDM = snorer.event(mx,Rstar,beta,is_spike=False,neval=50000)
+    >>> N_BDM
+    1.662174035857532e-06
+
+Suppose it happened in Super-Kamiokande with $N_e\approx 7\times 10^{33}$ and assume $\sigma_{\chi e}=10^{-30}$ cm<sup>2</sup>. The correct $N_{\rm BDM}$ would be
+
+    >>> Ne,sigma_xe = 7e33,1e-35
+    >>> N_BDM*Ne*sigma_xe
+    1.1635218251002724e-07
+
+### *Experimental* :: Implementation of Particle Physics Model and SN in Arbitrary Distant Galaxy
+
+The aforementioned functions for evaluating BDM signatures are based on model-agnostic picture. It means the cross sections between dark and visble sectors are generally independent of any physical quantities, eg. energy, mass and coupling constants.
+
+The most important feature of `snorer` is that it offers a general interface for users to implement their favorite particle models.
+Furthermore, SN is not necessary residing in MW or LMC. As long as users can provide these celetial objects' coordinates expressed in *ICRS J2000.0* system, `snorer` can do the calculation.
+`snorer` also allows users to customize the halo shape, by manipulating $\rho_s$, $r_s$ and $n$...etc, and including or excluding spike feature, of such distant galaxy.
+
+This will be done by introducing a *class* `snorer.GeneralInterface`.
+All these user-specified features will compose an instance of `snorer.GeneralInterface`.
+The BDM signatures can be evaluated by calling the associated *methods* within it.
+We have an example in `examples/tutorial.ipynb`, also see the in-class docstring for more information.
+
+
+### Other Useful Functions Classes
+
+We also provide many useful functions and classes at users' disposal. See `examples/tutorial.ipynb` for details.
+
+## Known Issue
+
+To evaluate BDM event, `snorer` uses `vegas` to handle the multidimensional integration.
+The sampling method of `vegas` cannot manipulate`snorer.event()` as well as the method in the instance of `snorer.GeneralInterface` properly, when SN is exactly at GC with spike feature turning on and no DM self-annihilation.
 
-where `vegas` is a the backend engine for evaluating multidimensional integrals based on adaptive Monte Carlo vegas algorithm, see its homepage: [https://pypi.org/project/vegas/](https://pypi.org/project/vegas/).
+Since the spike is a highly singular behavior, the sampling method may miss the substantial DM contribution from the inner galactic region and causes underestimate of $N_{\rm BDM}$ plus unstable results. 
+To avoid this, users may try to displace the SN from GC when evaluating $N_{\rm BDM}$ whith DM sipke turning on and no DM annihilation.
+For BDM flux evaluation, there is no such issue.
 
-Other packages, e.g. `gvar`, maybe required by these dependencies during the installation.
-The versions of these dependencies are not strict, but are recommended to update to the latest ones to avoid incompatibility. 
+To be fair, the probability of a very cuspy DM spike surving the gravitational disturbance without annihilating away and SN happening exactly at the GC might be very rare.
 
+This issue is scheduled to fix in the next version of `snorer`.

 ### Dependency
 
-`dukes` requires these external packages
+`snorer` requires python >= 3.8 and the following packages these external packages
 
 - `numpy` >= 1.20.0
 - `scipy` >= 1.10.0
 - `vegas` >= 6.0.1
+- `astropy` >= 6.0.0
+
+where `vegas` is a the backend engine for evaluating multidimensional integrals based on adaptive Monte Carlo vegas algorithm, see its homepage: <a heref = "https://pypi.org/project/vegas/" target = "_blank">https://pypi.org/project/vegas/</a>.
+
+Other packages maybe required by these dependencies during the installation, see `requirements.txt` for details.
+The versions of these dependencies are not strict, but are recommended to update to the latest ones to avoid incompatibility.
+
+## Usage
+
+We briefly summarize the usage in this section and a comprehensive tutorial can be found in the jupyter notebook in `examples/tutorial.ipynb`.
+
+To import, do
+
+    >>> import snorer
+
+in python terminal and is similar in the jupyter notebook.
+All functions and classes can be accessed by typing `snorer.foo()` where `foo` is the name.
+
+
+
+
+### Useful Constants
+
+We document various useful physical constants and conversion factors...etc as the *attributes* of an instance `snorer.constant`.
+For example, we can retrieve
+
+    >>> snorer.constant.me      # electron mas, MeV
+    0.511
+    >>> snorer.constant.kpc2cm  # kpc to cm
+    3.085e+21
+
+We did this instead of naming them as constant variables in some module to prevent them from being edited.
+
+### BDM Velocity
+
+A boosted dark matter (BDM) with mass $m_\chi$ and kinetic energy $T_\chi$ has the velocity $v_\chi$,
+
+$$
+\frac{v_\chi}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{T_\chi(2m_\chi+T_\chi)}}{m_\chi+T_\chi}.
+$$
+
+Let $(T_\chi,m_\chi)=(15,0.075)$ MeV, we can use
+`snorer.get_vx()` to evaluate
+
+    >>> Tx,mx = 15,0.075
+    >>> snorer.get_vx(Tx,mx)
+    0.9999876239921284
+
+
+### SN*Î½* BDM Flux 
+
+The BDM flux, or *afterglow* to the ${\rm SN}\nu$, due to SN that is $R_\star$ distant away from us can be evaluated by 
+
+$$
+\frac{d\Phi_{\chi}(T_\chi, t^\prime)}{dT_{\chi}dt} =
+\tau\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\sin\theta d\theta~ \mathcal{J} j_{\chi}(r(\phi),D,T_{\chi},\psi)
+$$
+
+where $t$ is the BDM ToF with time-zero at the discovery of SN*Î½* on Earth and $t^\prime$ is the total time. We focus on $t$ instead of $t^\prime$.
+Zenith angle $\theta$ and azimuthal angle $\phi$ are relative to the SN-Earth line-of-sight. The default DM-*Î½* cross section is $\sigma_{\chi\nu}=10^{-45}$ cm<sup>2</sup>.
+
+The function to evaluate this flux is `snorer.flux()` with $(t,T_\chi,m_\chi,R_\star,\beta)$ are the necessary inputs. 
+Suppose SN's location is at GC, we have $R_\star=8.5$ kpc and $\beta=0$, and examine the flux with turning on DM spike feature
+
+    >>> t,Tx,mx,Rstar,beta = 100,15,1e-2,8.5,0
+    >>> snorer.flux(t,Tx,mx,Rstar,beta,neval=15000)
+    4.572295175982701e-16
+
+Users can turn off the spike feature by inserting `is_spike=False` and will find both numerical results are similar. It implies the contribution to the BDM flux is due to the place outside the spike's influencial region.
+
+### SN*Î½* BDM Event
+
+The BDM event number in a detector after exposing to the flux for a period of time, $(t_{\rm min},t_{\rm max})$, can be evaluated by
+
+$$
+N_{\rm BDM} = \int_{t_{\rm min}}^{\rm t_{\rm max}} dt \int_{T_{\chi,{\rm min}}}^{T_{\chi,{\rm max}}}
+\frac{d\Phi_{\chi}(T_\chi, t^\prime)}{dT_{\chi}dt} \times N_e \sigma_{\chi e}
+$$
+
+where $N_e$ is the total electron number in the detector and $\sigma_{\chi e}$ the DM-*e* cross section.
+This can be accomplished by `snorer.event()` with $(m_\chi,R_\star,\beta)$ the necessary inputs.
+The default $(t_{\rm min},t_{\rm max})=(10~{\rm s},35~{\rm yrs})$ and $(T_{\chi,{\rm min}},T_{\chi,{\rm max}})=(5,30)$ MeV.
+
+Note that this function is normalized to $N_e=1$ and $\sigma_{\chi e}=1$ cm<sup>2</sup>.
+To have the correct $N_{\rm BDM}$ in a specific detector, users have to mutiply the corresponding $N_e$ and $\sigma_{\chi e}$.
+
+Now let $m_\chi=0.015$ MeV,
+
+    >>> mx,Rstar,beta = 0.015,8,0
+    >>> N_BDM = snorer.event(mx,Rstar,beta,is_spike=False,neval=50000)
+    >>> N_BDM
+    1.662174035857532e-06
+
+Suppose it happened in Super-Kamiokande with $N_e\approx 7\times 10^{33}$ and assume $\sigma_{\chi e}=10^{-30}$ cm<sup>2</sup>. The correct $N_{\rm BDM}$ would be
+
+    >>> Ne,sigma_xe = 7e33,1e-35
+    >>> N_BDM*Ne*sigma_xe
+    1.1635218251002724e-07
+
+### *Experimental* :: Implementation of Particle Physics Model and SN in Arbitrary Distant Galaxy
+
+The aforementioned functions for evaluating BDM signatures are based on model-agnostic picture. It means the cross sections between dark and visble sectors are generally independent of any physical quantities, eg. energy, mass and coupling constants.
+
+The most important feature of `snorer` is that it offers a general interface for users to implement their favorite particle models.
+Furthermore, SN is not necessary residing in MW or LMC. As long as users can provide these celetial objects' coordinates expressed in *ICRS J2000.0* system, `snorer` can do the calculation.
+`snorer` also allows users to customize the halo shape, by manipulating $\rho_s$, $r_s$ and $n$...etc, and including or excluding spike feature, of such distant galaxy.
+
+This will be done by introducing a *class* `snorer.GeneralInterface`.
+All these user-specified features will compose an instance of `snorer.GeneralInterface`.
+The BDM signatures can be evaluated by calling the associated *methods* within it.
+We have an example in `examples/tutorial.ipynb`, also see the in-class docstring for more information.
+
+
+### Other Useful Functions Classes
+
+We also provide many useful functions and classes at users' disposal. See `examples/tutorial.ipynb` for details.
+
+## Known Issue
+
+To evaluate BDM event, `snorer` uses `vegas` to handle the multidimensional integration.
+The sampling method of `vegas` cannot manipulate`snorer.event()` as well as the method in the instance of `snorer.GeneralInterface` properly, when SN is exactly at GC with spike feature turning on and no DM self-annihilation.
 
-where `vegas` is a the backend engine for evaluating multidimensional integrals based on adaptive Monte Carlo vegas algorithm, see its homepage: [https://pypi.org/project/vegas/](https://pypi.org/project/vegas/).
+Since the spike is a highly singular behavior, the sampling method may miss the substantial DM contribution from the inner galactic region and causes underestimate of $N_{\rm BDM}$ plus unstable results. 
+To avoid this, users may try to displace the SN from GC when evaluating $N_{\rm BDM}$ whith DM sipke turning on and no DM annihilation.
+For BDM flux evaluation, there is no such issue.
 
-Other packages, e.g. `gvar`, maybe required by these dependencies during the installation.
-The versions of these dependencies are not strict, but are recommended to update to the latest ones to avoid incompatibility. 
+To be fair, the probability of a very cuspy DM spike surving the gravitational disturbance without annihilating away and SN happening exactly at the GC might be very rare.
 
+This issue is scheduled to fix in the next version of `snorer`.
